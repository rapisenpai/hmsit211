        <p style="font-size: 30px" class="">It is referring to the health information of the patients which only the
            administrator can
            access
            and manage
            their
            healthcare data. This system is designed to manage patient information with basic CRUD operations. Health
            information
            systems can be used by everyone in healthcare from patients to clinicians to public health officials. They
            collect data
            and compile it in a way that can be used to make healthcare decisions.</p>
